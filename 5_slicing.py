Slicing
    It is a process of fetching out part of a collection in a sequential manner.
    Syntax: var[SI:EI:Updation]
            where SI is Starting Index
                  EI is Ending Index
                  Updation is number of steps

    Slicing can be done with only those datatypes which support indexing.
